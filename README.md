# Active-learning-using-outlier-detection





This project contains 4 main folders 
•	1MNIST 
•	2FASHION
•	Comparing
•	Visualization (Core_set and Outliers)



(1Mnist & 1Fashoin) folders contain 3 subfolders:
CNN
LeNet
ResNet 
Each subfolder contains the code to run (the proposed AL framework) based on the specific architecture (CNN, LeNet, or ResNet). Moreover, it contains the code of applying the specific architecture over the all set used (MNIST or FASHOINMNIST)


Comparing folder contains the code to compare the implementation of the proposed AL by using different classifiers (CNN, LeNet, or ResNet)


The visualization (Core_set and Outliers) folder contains the code for visualization of the embedding distribution of initial selected data, The embedding distribution of core-subset, and The embedding distribution of outlier points.
